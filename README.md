# ZAMS Data Analysis
The Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) is the moment when a star begins to be part of the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) where hydrogen in its nucleus is burned through fusion reactions.

In this Test, the internal structure of a star at ZAMS was calculated using a software developed by Prof. Dr. Gustavo P. Mello (UFRJ) and Prof. Dr. Basilio Santiago (UFRGS) in Fortran 77.

Data for solar conditions were generated through the code in Fortran 77 and then the analysis of the data extracted in this code were performed in python.

This code was part of the Stellar Evolution I course attended at INPE in 2021 by Professor Dr. Andr√© Milone.

This is an independent data analysis.
